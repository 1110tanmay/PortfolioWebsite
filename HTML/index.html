           <h2> So, Hello! I'm Tanmay, I hope you felt nice talking to me (well, virtual me). I can be mean sometimes, 
            you should know though that I am training myself (virtual self) better with each day passing. I built this website,
            using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js. The functionality of the website goes beyond this, I integrated my virtual self
            by using the OpenAi API, I mean generativeAi (GenAI) is so cool, right? 
           </br>
          </br>
            But I mean hey, traditional ways are cool as well! So, if you want to go by that, you can scroll further.

            <p>
                <h2 id="aboutMeHeading">What am I currently doing?</h2>
                <p>
                  Currently, I am working on a research project of healthcare under the course of Semantic Web Engineering. </br>
                  <h2 id="aboutMeHeading">Why though?</h2></br>
                  I know you'd ask. Alrighty, so while we are privileaged to have accessible healthacare, some don't. While the world
                  is currently trying to solve the problem, I thought why not do something on a smaller scale with the technology that 
                  I am learning. I mean, what is the use of technology if not for benefitting the society, right? 
                  So in under developed countries where people doctors don't get relevant information or even where the medical
                  education is not up to the date. What if there was a software accessible to doctors/practitioners where they could
                  input the patient's symptoms, history, daily habits, and based on the input, the software would be give out
                  information related to what possible disease the patient might have? 
                  Amazing right? so that is what I am building. 
                 </br>
                  <h2 id="aboutMeHeading">How am I doing it though?</h2></br>
                  See? I knew you'd ask. Alright, let me explain. So I have gathered relevant data (non-protected healthcare information) 
                  from different sources, and built a database around the same, this is all the backend. For the front-end I built an interface
                  using Flutter, it's amazing because with the same codebase I was able to build a web-app, an iOS app and an Android app. 
                  Based on the inputs by the doctor, queries are run (I wrote SPARQL queries) and relevant information is shared. 
                </br>
                  Now currently this does not involve Artificial intelligence, however in the future, I would be training a model after
                  I have sufficient data to predict the disease of the patient. Of course you can reach out to me for more questions around the
                  same.
